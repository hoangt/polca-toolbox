# FlexaWare

FlexaWare has been developed by Recore Systems.
FlexaWare is an embedded heterogeneous many-core processing platform, 
comprising a many-core hardware architecture and a many-core coordination software layer.

The embedded many-core platform offers flexibility and scalability to cater to range of 
application domains from clear cut to compute intensive and massively parallel.

The many-core architecture can be implemented on FPGA or ASIC. 
FlexaWare offers abstraction from the many-core hardware complexity using a task-based programming model.

The programming model targets heterogeneous distributed (shared) memory systems. 
An application runs on top of the many-core coordination software layer. 
Applications are composed hierarchically of explicitly defined tasks and communication channels.
